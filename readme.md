This project is used to deal with two main tasks:
First one is that I use  python programming language to use lasso algorithms in the machine learning to solve some problems in the applications.(the codes are in the first file)
The second one is that I use coordinate descent methods to implement lasso regression in the machine learning(using python programming), and the codes are in the second file.

Noticeï¼š the project assignment is from the Coursera class (machine learning) which was conducted by University of Washington (Seattle).
